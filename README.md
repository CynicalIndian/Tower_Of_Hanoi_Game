# Tower_Of_Hanoi_Game

A Simple Game built in 2 hrs that still has a lot of glitches. 
Some of the glitches that I personally disliked are listed below

1) Missing 'Undo' functionality to reverse back Moves
2) The Page isn't Responsive , or even if it's trust me the layout is horrible on Medium & Small Screens 
3) Some Error cases still have to be looked into
4) Less Interactivity .....

   and more to come from you ........... !
